            <h2>Chapter One: Why I Started To Learn To Code.</h2>
        
            <p>Yes its right,</p>
        
            <p>Everyone has a different way of thinking about something, and when shit hits the fan 
              everything gets exposed.

              <p>This is a song by

            <p>It was back in 2017 when i realised that doing something you don't love will ruin the the whole life.
              so i started to deploy more and more time towards finding things that i enjoyed and building Websites and Designing them became one.

            </blockquote>
        
            <p>At the same time i got employed as a Electrical Testing Engineer at a company. I had to do this to pay my rentals and bills.
              My family supported me at every stage of them all, And i can't tell you how much i love them.

            <p>So around last year i was a graduate student and wanted to get into this 
              Tech Industry by any means. I did a google search and first result was from a Ad.(Yes i was caught).
              It was from <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Teamtreehouse</a>, an online learning platform where they has expert teachers teach you how to code.
            </p>
        
        
            <blockquote>
              <p>"Every master was once a beginner."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Learning to code from treehouse was easy as it was structured for the beginner. Once i finished their Frontend Developer Path, I joined Linkedin's Learning Platform which was <a href="https://lynda.com">Lynda.com</a>.
             While doing this all music was with me, having a song playing as you code was a good fit.</p>
        
            <div class="tip tip-left">
              <p>You can listen to this song on
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gvpej9TT-g">YouTube</a>
                I listen when i code.
              </p>
            </div>
        
            <p>So let me tell you it's hard and difficult to get to use this. Waking up 4:30 in the morning
              every day to start something you have to finish, it's furstrating but that's what i love about it.

            <h2>Dear Time</h2>
        
            <p>Now it's time to put in the work as Gary Vaynerchuk says, "If you want things that you never had in your life, you got to do things you have never done".</p>

            <p>So less takling and More Doing.</p>
